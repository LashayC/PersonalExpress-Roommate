# The Neighborhood
A message board for neibhors to share and post what's happening in the backyard.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

I built this app by first building the forms to organize how data would be sent to mongodb. From there I formatted with app to fit the style of a message board and moved on to rendering it in ejs.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

For this project I added additional updates for post reactions to provide more options for a client interacting with the board. I also add condtitionals in EJS to avoid rendering any properties that weren't given a value in the form. 

## Lessons Learned:

I got comfortable with using more javascript within EJS and using bootstrap for CSS.
